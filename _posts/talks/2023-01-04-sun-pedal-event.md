The SunPedal Ride is an outreach project started by Mr. Sushil Reddy in 2016, with the idea of kick starting conversations about clean energy and sustainable mobility. Each edition of the ride features a journey undertaken on zero tail-pipe emission vehicles. In 2023, this journey was undertaken from 12th March to 1st June over a period of 82 days covering 11,000+ kilometres from Kanyakumari to Kashmir.

In collaboration with E-Cell IIIT Hyderabad, a session was held on April 1st, featuring Mr. Sushil, who shared his experiences and insights on sustainable mobility and clean energy. The discussions delved into the challenges of EV adoption, aiming to encourage a shift towards a cleaner, greener future. Participants engaged in interactive quizzes and Q&A sessions, enhancing their understanding of EVs and sustainability. The event was a great success and received positive feedback from the attendees.

The SunPedal Ride is not just a journey, but it is also an opportunity to spread awareness about sustainability and the future of EVs in the country. The team is conducting various sessions and discussions with students, professionals, and common people along the way to create awareness about the benefits of EVs and how they can contribute to a cleaner and greener future.
