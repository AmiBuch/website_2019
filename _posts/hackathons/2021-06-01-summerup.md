There’s 104 days of summer vacation of 2021, and the lockdown has just messed it up. <br>
So <strong>E-Cell IIIT-H, in collaboration with OSDG IIIT-H</strong>, has came up with a solution, our 40-day event called “SummerUp”!<br><br>

Bring out your inner innovator and <strong>come up with a project idea which has the potential to solve a problem (and win prizes, of course!) and around which a sustainable startup can be built</strong>, 
the startup can be a profitable one or a social entrepreneurship based not for profit startup. Then in a 40 day period, implement the technologies related to it. Team up with as many friends as you want, there are no restrictions at all! (But keep in mind that you want to have a decent share of prize money per person.)
<br><br>
The main goal of this event is to help you see exactly how your idea can progress into a real world application and the amount of hard work required in order to bring it into reality. <strong>It’s okay if you haven’t got the technical skills to implement your ideas </strong>yet, that’s what this platform is for! With the help of our amazing <strong>mentors to guide you with the technical aspects,</strong> you’ll gain new skills and be able to get your hands dirty with them over the course of under two months.
