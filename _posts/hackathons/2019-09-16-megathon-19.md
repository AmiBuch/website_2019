Megathon 2019, India's largest student-run hackathon, was a resounding success, showcasing the spirit of innovation and entrepreneurship among the student community. Organised by E-Cell IIIT Hyderabad, this fourth edition of Megathon had some remarkable features.

Embibe, as the title sponsor, and Micron India, Qualcomm, and PwC as associate sponsors, added prestige and support to the event. With over 1000 participants hailing from 35 cities and 65 colleges, it was a true representation of the nation's best talent.

Innovations were not limited to the campus, as Megathon introduced an online event called HOWZHACK, making it a nationwide phenomenon. Multiple problem statements provided participants with a platform to showcase their creativity and problem-solving skills. HOWZHACK took place on 7th August, followed by the 24-hour onsite hackathon on IIIT Campus grounds on 28th September.

The event's success was evident as participants had multiple opportunities to win desirable goodies, with the top five teams for each problem statement being awarded. Megathon 2019 not only provided students with a unique opportunity to test their skills but also fostered the spirit of entrepreneurship and development in the Indian student community, making it a memorable and enriching experience.
