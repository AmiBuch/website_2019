                There’s 104 days of summer vacation, and the lockdown has just messed it up. <br>
                So <strong>E-Cell IIIT-H, in collaboration with Walmart and OSDG IIIT-H</strong>, has come up with a solution, our 40-day event called “SummerUp”!<br><br>

                Bring out your inner innovator and <strong>come up with a <span style="color:red"> project idea</span> which has the potential to solve a problem (and win prizes, of course!) and around which a sustainable startup can be built</strong>, <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/imgs/The_head.png" alt="head picture" class ="wrap-pic img-fluid "></img>
                the startup can be a profitable one or a social entrepreneurship based not for profit startup. Then in a 40 day period, implement the technologies related to it. Team up with as many friends as you want, there are no restrictions at all! (But keep in mind that you want to have a decent share of prize money per person.)
                <br><br>
                The main goal of this event is to help you see exactly how your idea can progress into a real world application and the amount of hard work required in order to bring it into reality. <strong>It’s okay if you haven’t got the technical skills to implement your ideas </strong>yet, that’s what this platform is for! With the help of our amazing <strong>mentors to guide you with the technical aspects,</strong> you’ll gain new skills and be able to get your hands dirty with them over the course of under two months.

                <li>To help keep your creative juices flowing and that motivation drive running, there’ll be an <strong>evaluation at the end of 20 days</strong> that will help keep you on the right track. As your project evolves, we’ll be there every step of the way to help it transform into the best it can be!</li>
                <br><br>
                <li>At the end of our 40 day program, we would have the final evaluation and prizes will be awarded in three categories. </li>
                <br><br>
                <li>Teams would be required to present their idea which would be <strong>judged on 2 major factors -</strong> how well you’ve implemented the product and how feasible and sustainable your idea when it comes to “real world”.</li>
                <br>So go ahead, get started! We can’t wait to hear about your ideas, and get this event rolling!
